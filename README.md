Monad
=====

monad. Js

I always wanted to make some experiments with monads,
so, in order to start my new Query project, I though it was a good idea to implement it in pure javascript.

I made two version o it, the Monad.js is a standard monad while the Monad.Maybe is the Maybe Monad implementation.

In the Tests folder I check for the three axioms to pass.

Enjoy ;)
